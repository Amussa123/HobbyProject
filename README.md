Adventurers Guild by Adam Mussa

This Projected is a full-stack web application which allows users to Create, Update and Delete their Adventurer. The project was created with the three-tier architecture in mind in order to prevent coupling. The frontend of the website was coded in JavaScript, HTML & CSS, Using Visual Studio Code as an IDE. The backend was coded using Spring (Java) alongside with SQL for the database layer. An API was developed using Spring in order to communicate between the frontend and the backend components.
